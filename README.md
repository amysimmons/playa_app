# **[Playa](https://playa-app.herokuapp.com)**

##Problem

Music hogs 

##The Solution 

Democratically chosen playlists

##Libraries, Gems and other stuff

- underscore.js
- backbone.js

- gem 'font-awesome-rails'
- gem 'ruby-oembed'
- gem 'soundcloud'

##Sore bits

- The front page

- Repeated code 

- Guests can't preview songs

- Creator can only skip to a new track by shuffling

- Backbone in general 

##Cool beans

- Shuffling

- Voting to skip tracks 

- Continuous play 

##What's next?

- Allow YouTube URLs to be added

- Allow SoundCloud / YouTube search

- Allows song preview on guest view of playlist

- Allow playlist creator to edit playlist and delete songs

- Allow users to fork other people's playlists 

- Show skipped songs

- Real time polling for votes and new songs

- Checks for presence of album artwork, checks for presence of URL when new songs are added 

- Responsive styling
